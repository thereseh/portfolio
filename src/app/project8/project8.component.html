    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>Designed from the ground up using Angular2</h2>
    <p>When it was time for me to build this site I decided to embrace the opporturnity to learn a new framwork. After some consideration, I went for Angular2.<br><br>In addition, Bootstrap is used to help with the design. For example, the project page is using the carousel component to wrap the project images. It allowed me to easily format the images and put information text over them.<br><br>
     I also wrote a NodeJS express server, which was necessary for Heroku to be able to build and deploy the project.</p>
